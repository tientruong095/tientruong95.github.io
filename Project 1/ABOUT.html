            <p> Kenny with his first given name Tien, started his passion with videos in middle school. He wanted to do everything in video and become a YouTube celebrity, but it all changed during his last year in high school. As a senior, Kenny tried many different things from nursing, pharmaceutical sciences, bartending, dancing, business, psychology, and even law enforcement.

                <br>
                Afer 4 years of trying different fields he realized what the most important thing to him was.

                <br>
                He loved doing things different and being the first to try something out. Eventually design became more than a passion to him.
